Pseudocode :
Made class ‘ReverseListAndRemoveDuplicates’ 
Used new ArrayList to make a list with different fruits where ‘Apple’ appears twice. 
Then displayed it as ‘Original List’
After that, manually removed the duplicates using iteration and contains() method.
Displayed this as ‘List after removing duplicates’
Then, used Stack to reverse the list.
And displayed it as ‘Reversed List’
